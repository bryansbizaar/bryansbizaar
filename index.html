              <p>
                My musical journey began in Maryland (USA) when I started violin
                in the 2nd grade. I was lured in by the prospect of learning the
                Star Wars theme song and then got hooked on Christmas tunes and
                Kenny Rodgers. I wasn't raised in a particularly musical
                household, though my parents had a very modest record collection
                plus whatever was playing on 70s pop-country radio. I also
                remember hearing Elvis and Hank Williams whenever I visited my
                grandparents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sadly, I quit the violin after moving to Germany when I was
                about 9. My teacher was a bit too serious and it simply took the
                fun out of music. I was encouraged to take piano lessons, but I
                never really took to it as an instrument. I then tried the cello
                and quit after another sour and unpleasant teacher in middle
                school.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started to become aware of my own music in the late 70s and
                early 80s, listening to mainly whatever was on the radio at the
                time. Some of my early favorites were I Love Rock 'n' Roll (Joan
                Jett & the Blackhearts), Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2 (Pink
                Floyd), Another One Bites The Dust (Queen), and Heart Of Glass
                (Blondie). I have a cousin that introduced me to a few rock
                bands from the 70s including the Who and Kiss, and I was given a
                copy of For Those About To Rock, We Salute You (AC/DC) when I
                was around 11. It was one of my first albums along with Kiss
                Alive II.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was inspired to take guitar lessons after discovering Rush,
                especially after watching Exit Stage Left. I was around 13 and
                my teacher was a jazz guitarist who was also into prog rock.
                Among other things, he showed me how to play Horizons by Steve
                Hackett. He also taught me how to slow down the record player to
                half-speed and learn things by ear. We started with the riff
                from Life's Been Good So Far (Joe Walsh), and I was soon working
                out things on my own including from Rush (a lot from Exit Stage
                Left and Moving Pictures), Santana (the Abraxas album), Clapton
                (Cocaine), Yes (Roundabout, Mood For A Day), AC/DC ( the Back In
                Black album), Ozzy/Randy Rhodes, Van Halen, and Black Sabbath
                (the first two albums). I also learned a lot from the tablature
                in Guitar Player magazine, but whatever I couldn't find there I
                had to learn by ear. Having the tab did inspire me to check out
                unfamiliar music and within about two years, I could pick out
                and reasonably execute almost anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was fortunate to have a musical friend with a brother who was
                a drummer. Their band practiced in his basement, and my buddy
                and I would jam down there whenever we got the chance providing
                the space was free. We assembled a band and won the high school
                battle of the bands my junior year. I think we may have played
                White Wedding and You Really Got Me. I formed another cover band
                the following year and we won again playing YYZ and Sweet Child
                'O Mine.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also had a great music class in high school called 'Folk
                Rock'. It covered the basics of the music business, performance,
                and recording. We worked up a set and performed at local
                schools, plus we went into the studio and cut a few tracks each
                year. It even led to my first studio gig.
              </p>
              <p>
                My repertoire started to include some jazz and I was hired to
                play guitar for a show featuring Hoagy Carmichael's music. I
                also branched out and played in the pit orchestra for the
                musical Annie. I ended up going to university in Boone, NC,
                where they offered a major in Music Industry Studies. It was
                part music theory/performance, part music business (publishing,
                recording, merchandise), and part general business (marketing,
                finance, accounting, economics). I did my internship at RCA
                records in Nashville, TN, and left feeling completely
                disillusioned by the commodification of music. I still wanted to
                be a pro, but I'm a bit stubborn and was only interested in
                doing things on my own terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                I formed an original band in college called the Madcap Laughs.
                We eventually grew apart after graduation and I bought a one-way
                ticket for what became a 6-year stint traveling and living
                throughout Europe, Ireland and the South Pacific. I mostly
                travelled with an acoustic guitar and grew interested in
                traditional music from around the world. I took up the octave
                mandolin and then the clarinet in order to play a growing
                repertoire of Irish, Scandinavian and Eastern European music,
                some of which was released on the album Bryan's Bizaar in 2001.
                I also began performing and recording with the NZ
                singer-songwriter Nina Lane and together, we moved to Portland,
                OR, where we eventually became full-time teachers and
                entrepreneurs.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was involved in a lot of great projects while living in
                Portland including Kafana Klub (Balkan folk-dance band), Heathen
                Collective (original improvisation), Kendálin (original
                world-folk ensemble), Mistral (Breton folk-dance band),
                Switchgrass (bluegrass/newgrass), Sprygg (world folk ensemble),
                and Terracoustic (original new acoustic), all while continuing
                to work with Nina Lane. Along with the acoustic guitar and
                octave mandolin, I also picked up the mandolin and fiddle during
                this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a long hiatus from the electric guitar, I began performing
                and recording with the rock band King Black Acid from 2016
                through 2020, including a stint with the Gabby Holt band. This
                inspired me to build my own tube amplifiers modeled on mid-60s
                Fenders, plus I even built a few pedals and a beautiful
                semi-hollow guitar.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the present, I currently live in New Zealand and perform
                with Nina Lane and other local musicians.

                  improvisational project active in the early 2000s in Portland,
                  OR. It consisted of me on octave mandolin, Erica Pedro on
                  guitar and vocals, and Peter Jones on percussion. Most of
                  these songs were birthed during live improv jams and were
                  loosely developed into complete songs. This recording only
                  captured a moment in time as the songs changed and morphed
                  every time they were played.
