          <p>
            My musical journey began in Maryland (USA) when I started violin in
            the 2nd grade. I was lured in by the prospect of learning the Star
            Wars theme song and then got hooked on Christmas tunes and Kenny
            Rodgers. I wasn't raised in a particularly musical household, though
            my parents had a very modest record collection plus whatever was
            playing on 70s pop-country radio. I also remember hearing Elvis and
            Hank Williams whenever I visited my grandparents.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sadly, I quit the violin after moving to Germany when I was about 9.
            My teacher was a bit too serious and it simply took the fun out of
            music. I was encouraged to take piano lessons, but I never really
            took to it as an instrument. I then tried the cello and quit after
            another sour and unpleasant teacher in middle school.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started to become aware of my own music in the late 70s and early
            80s, listening to mainly whatever was on the radio at the time. Some
            of my early favorites were I Love Rock 'n' Roll (Joan Jett & the
            Blackhearts), Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2 (Pink Floyd), Another
            One Bites The Dust (Queen), and Heart Of Glass (Blondie). I have a
            cousin that introduced me to a few rock bands from the 70s including
            the Who and Kiss, and I was given a copy of For Those About To Rock,
            We Salute You (AC/DC) when I was around 11. It was one of my first
            albums along with Kiss Alive II.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was inspired to take guitar lessons after discovering Rush,
            especially after watching Exit Stage Left. I was around 13 and my
            teacher was a jazz guitarist who was also into prog rock. Among
            other things, he showed me how to play Horizons by Steve Hackett. He
            also taught me how to slow down the record player to half-speed and
            learn things by ear. We started with the riff from Life's Been Good
            So Far (Joe Walsh), and I was soon working out things on my own
            including from Rush (a lot from Exit Stage Left and Moving
            Pictures), Santana (the Abraxas album), Clapton (Cocaine), Yes
            (Roundabout, Mood For A Day), AC/DC ( the Back In Black album),
            Ozzy/Randy Rhodes, Van Halen, and Black Sabbath (the first two
            albums). I also learned a lot from the tablature in Guitar Player
            magazine, but whatever I couldn't find there I had to learn by ear.
            Having the tab did inspire me to check out unfamiliar music and
            within about two years, I could pick out and reasonably execute
            almost anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was fortunate to have a musical friend with a brother who was a
            drummer. Their band practiced in his basement, and my buddy and I
            would jam down there whenever we got the chance providing the space
            was free. We assembled a band and won the high school battle of the
            bands my junior year. I think we may have played White Wedding and
            You Really Got Me. I formed another cover band the following year
            and we won again playing YYZ and Sweet Child 'O Mine.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also had a great music class in high school called 'Folk Rock'.
            It covered the basics of the music business, performance, and
            recording. We worked up a set and performed at local schools, plus
            we went into the studio and cut a few tracks each year. It even led
            to my first studio gig.
          </p>

          <p>
            My repertoire started to include some jazz and I was hired to play
            guitar for a show featuring Hoagy Carmichael's music. I also
            branched out and played in the pit orchestra for the musical Annie.
            I ended up going to university in Boone, NC, where they offered a
            major in Music Industry Studies. It was part music
            theory/performance, part music business (publishing, recording,
            merchandise), and part general business (marketing, finance,
            accounting, economics). I did my internship at RCA records in
            Nashville, TN, and left feeling completely disillusioned by the
            commodification of music. I still wanted to be a pro, but I'm a bit
            stubborn and was only interested in doing things on my own terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            I formed an original band in college called the Madcap Laughs. We
            eventually grew apart after graduation and I bought a one-way ticket
            for what became a 6-year stint traveling and living throughout
            Europe, Ireland and the South Pacific. I mostly travelled with an
            acoustic guitar and grew interested in traditional music from around
            the world. I took up the octave mandolin and then the clarinet in
            order to play a growing repertoire of Irish, Scandinavian and
            Eastern European music, some of which was released on the album
            Bryan's Bizaar in 2001. I also began performing and recording with
            the NZ singer-songwriter Nina Lane and together, we moved to
            Portland, OR, where we eventually became full-time teachers and
            entrepreneurs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was involved in a lot of great projects while living in Portland
            including Kafana Klub (Balkan folk-dance band), Heathen Collective
            (original improvisation), Kend√°lin (original world-folk ensemble),
            Mistral (Breton folk-dance band), Switchgrass (bluegrass/newgrass),
            Sprygg (world folk ensemble), and Terracoustic (original new
            acoustic), all while continuing to work with Nina Lane. Along with
            the acoustic guitar and octave mandolin, I also picked up the
            mandolin and fiddle during this time.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a long hiatus from the electric guitar, I began performing and
            recording with the rock band King Black Acid from 2016 through 2020,
            including a stint with the Gabby Holt band. This inspired me to
            build my own tube amplifiers modeled on mid-60s Fenders, plus I even
            built a few pedals and a beautiful semi-hollow guitar.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for the present, I currently live in New Zealand and perform with
            Nina Lane and other local musicians.
