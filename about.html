    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
      My musical journey began in Maryland (USA) when I started violin in the
      2nd grade. I was lured in by the prospect of learning the Star Wars theme
      song and then got hooked on Christmas tunes and Kenny Rodgers. My parents
      had a very modest record collection and most of my early musical exposure
      was 70s pop-country radio. I also remember hearing Elvis and Hank Williams
      whenever I visited my grandparents.
    </p>

      Sadly, I quit the violin after moving to Germany when I was about 9. My
      teacher was a bit too serious and it simply took the fun out of music. I
      was encouraged to take piano lessons, but I never really took to it as an
      instrument. I then tried the cello and quit after another sour and
      unpleasant teacher in middle school.

      I started to become aware of my own music in the late 70s and early 80s,
      listening to mainly whatever was on pop radio at the time. Some of my
      early favorites were I Love Rock ’n' Roll (Joan Jett & the Blackhearts),
      Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2 (Pink Floyd), Another One Bites The Dust
      (Queen), and Heart Of Glass (Blondie). I have a cousin that introduced me
      to a few rock bands from the 70s including the Who and Kiss, and I was
      given a copy of For Those About To Rock, We Salute You (AC/DC) when I was
      around 11. It was one of my first albums along with Kiss Alive II.

      I was inspired to take guitar lessons after discovering Rush, especially
      after watching Exit Stage Left. I was around 13 and my teacher was a jazz
      guitarist who was also into prog rock. Among other things, he showed me
      how to play Horizons by Steve Hackett. He also taught me how to slow down
      the record player to half-speed (16) and learn things by ear. We started
      with the riff from Life’s Been Good So Far (Joe Walsh), and I was soon
      working out things on my own including Rush (lots off Exit Stage Left),
      Santana (the Abraxas album), Clapton (Cocaine), Yes (Roundabout, Mood For
      A Day), AC/DC ( the Back In Black album), Ozzy/Randy Rhodes, Van Halen,
      and Black Sabbath (the Paranoid album). I also learned a lot from the
      tablature in Guitar Player magazine, but whatever I couldn’t find there I
      had to learn by ear. Having the tab did inspire me to check out unfamiliar
      music and within about two years, I could pick out and reasonably execute
      almost anything.

      I was fortunate to have a musical friend with a brother who was a drummer.
      Their band practiced in his basement, and my buddy and I would jam down
      there whenever we got the chance and it was free. We assembled a band and
      won the high school battle of the bands my junior year. My memory is a bit
      hazy, but I think we may have played White Wedding and You Really Got Me.
      I formed another band the following year and we won again playing YYZ and
      Sweet Child ‘O Mine. We were quite the jukebox and billed ourselves as a
      party band that covered everything from Bryan Adams to Black Sabbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also had a great music class in high school called ‘Folk Rock’. It
      covered the basics of the music business, performance, and recording. We
      worked up a set and performed at local schools, plus we went into the
      studio and cut a few tracks each year. It even led to my first studio gig.
    </p>

      My repertoire started to include some jazz and I was hired to play guitar
      for a show featuring Hoagy Carmichael’s music. I also branched out and
      played in the pit orchestra for the musical Annie. I ended up going to
      university in Boone, NC, where they offered a major in Music Industry
      Studies. It was part music theory/performance, part music business
      (publishing, recording, merchandise), and part general business
      (marketing, finance, accounting, economics). I did my internship at RCA
      records in Nashville, TN, and left feeling completely disillusioned by the
      commodification of music. I still wanted to be a pro, but I’m a bit
      stubborn and was only interested in doing things on my own terms.

      I formed an original band in college called the Madcap Laughs and was
      prepared to follow wherever it led. Some of my bandmates however decided
      to choose a more ‘secure’ career path after graduation and committing to a
      full-time band was unfortunately not the priority. So I bought a one-way
      ticket for what became a 6-year stint traveling and living throughout
      Europe, Ireland and the South Pacific. I mostly travelled with an acoustic
      guitar and grew interested in traditional music from around the world. I
      took up the octave mandolin and then the clarinet in order to play a
      growing repertoire of Irish, Scandinavian and Eastern European music, some
      of which was released on the album Bryan’s Bizaar in 2001. I also began
      performing and recording with the NZ singer-songwriter Nina Lane and
      together, we moved to Portland, OR, where we eventually became full-time
      teachers and entrepreneurs.

      I was involved in a lot of great projects while living in Portland
      including Kafana Klub (Balkan folk-dance band), Heathen Collective
      (original improvisation), Kendálin (original world-folk ensemble), Mistral
      (Breton folk-dance band), Switchgrass (bluegrass/newgrass), Sprygg (world
      folk ensemble), and Terracoustic (original new acoustic), all while
      continuing to work with Nina Lane. Along with the acoustic guitar and
      octave mandolin, I also picked up the mandolin and fiddle during this
      time.

      After a long hiatus away from the electric guitar, I began performing and
      recording with the rock band King Black Acid from 2016 through 2020,
      including a stint with the Gabby Holt band. This inspired me to build my
      own tube amplifiers modeled on mid-60s Fenders, plus I even built a few
      pedals and a beautiful semi-hollow guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the present, I currently live in New Zealand and perform with Nina
      Lane and other local musicians.
